Multiboxing with Gw2Launcher:

- Go into Settings of the Account that should be displayed -> Launch options -> Tick Mumble link name and enter a name for it (i.e. MumbleLink_main)
- Update your gw2rpc config.ini to include the following section, or delete the file and let it be created upon starting gw2rpc:
    [Multiboxing]
    MumbleLink = MumbleLink_main

- GW2RPC will now always display the status of this specific open game instance / account.

Problems:
- If you start gw2rpc and your specified instance is not active, it will always display "in character selection". For now it seems like there is no way to identify if the correct process is running.
- If you start the game without Gw2Launcher, it will also display "in character selection" only, because it will default to the normal MumbleLink name (which is simply MumbleLink)
